Project Odyssey is a custom install for Kerbal Space Program.

NOTE! If you install any of this, you must install all of this. It's all interdependent. If you REALLY know what you're doing then you could get away with leaving out a few things, but probably only the visual mods.

Common problems with your installs might include:
* Not actually following all the steps so something is missing.
* A mod has changed since I downloaded my version of it. You may need to look around the new mod layout to find a part that for ME was in a differnet location when I downloaded it. Hopefull mod authors do not remove parts entirely.
* Errors while loading can cause an exception that causes KSP to stop loading the rest of your parts. If this happens then you may see very few mods/parts visible, and maybe not any parts at all.
* KSP 0.25 has an issue loading TGA files. Almost half the time I try to start KSP I get part way in andit hangs, or I get to the external VAB scene and the UI is unresponsive. I need to close and try again. It often works the second time. I ahve been slowly converting my TGAs to PNGs but I have not done them all yet, and so it keeps happening. I'm sure it'll happen to you too.
