Project Odyssey is a custom install for Kerbal Space Program.

NOTE! If you install any of this, you must install all of this. It's all interdependent. If you REALLY know what you're doing then you could get away with leaving out a few things, but probably only the visual mods.

Common problems with your installs might include:
* Not actually following all the steps so something is missing.
* A mod has changed since I downloaded my version of it. You may need to look around the new mod layout to find a part that for ME was in a differnet location when I downloaded it. Hopefully mod authors do not remove parts entirely.
* Errors while loading can cause an exception that causes KSP to stop loading the rest of your parts. If this happens then you may see very few mods/parts visible, and maybe not any parts at all.
* KSP 0.25 has an issue loading the space center if the window does not have focus during first three seconds of loading. You'll be stuck looking at a strange angle from the side of the space center.
* If you use my SPO mod and you change the filters then you may not see parts and forget why. Also the filters are additive, so if you filter by mod and filter by size, you might turn off one of those filters and still not see parts unless you turn off the second filter too.
